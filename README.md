# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
In this analysis, I examine Louiseâ€™s different campaigns in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the provided Kickstarter dataset this analysis visualizes campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. Prior to the completing the analysis, I combed through the Kickstarter data to gather information on category and subcategory statistics, and outcomes based on the launch date to better organize and understand the data. The final results are presented in multiple Excel sheets including two excel deliverables an outcome based on launch date chart and a outcome based on goals chart with corresponding images located in the resource folders.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date shows that overall, the total outcomes have a higher success rate than failure and cancellations. The outcomes are particularly favorable between April and July with success rates peaking in May and June. The success rate begins to decline as we approach the Fall and Winter months with the lowest month being in December where success (37) and failure (35) rates were almost identical.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals shows success percentage decline with a goal of 1000 to 19999, with all-time low success percentages coming with goal ranges of 15000 to 19999. During these same periods you see a higher percentage of failure. Success percentages begin to rise between a goal of 20000 to 44999, however failure percentages do not drop below the success percentages until a goal which ranges from 30000 to 44999. This success peak is short-lived, as success drops once again for any goal greater than 45000. This is the same range when cancelations begin to increase above the success percentages.

### Challenges

The biggest challenge I encountered was creating the Outcome Based on Goals. It took me a few tries to get the formula correct. However, once the I figured out the formula for the success table, the rest was a lot smoother to figure out.

## Results

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- When looking for more favorable outcomes the launch date criteria appears to be a more favorable measure for success versus when measure between a specific goal range. 

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- Outcome based on Goals shows a higher failure rate when each percentage is measured between specific Goal ranges.

What are some limitations of this dataset?
- Though we can measure the numbers of when success and failure can occur, we can't know for certain the environmental factors of why. Since data provides the facts, the story we paint is curated by the data we choose. HOW we choose to visualize it can shift the narrative based on what data we choose to use.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Another possible table and graph we can create is location based. Since we have country and currency related data, we can see what countries have more favorable outcomes for the Kickstarter.
